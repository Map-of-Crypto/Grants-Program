# Request for Proposals

## Abstract

> Provide a brief description of your idea here (1-2 paragraphs).
>Main idea was to develop decentralized platform for buying and selling goods worldwide via crypto or even fiat.We used and combined all functionality and usage of web3 components and build the application which is just a mock-up version. We have much more ideas to implement and work on the UI design and also we see potential in usage of that kind of application.
